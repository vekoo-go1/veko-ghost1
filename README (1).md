# Veko Ghost

> ⚠️ **WARNING**: This tool is intended for educational and controlled testing purposes only. Misuse can result in legal consequences. You assume all responsibility for using this software.

Veko Ghost is a stealth-grade task simulator and obfuscation engine designed to emulate network activity, trigger decoy endpoints, and simulate ghost presence in environments where traceability and detection need to be mitigated or redirected.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🫥 **Obfuscated Execution**: Payload runs under randomized patterns.
- 👻 **Ghost Task Engine**: Executes silent tasks mimicking real network operations.
- 🧬 **Task Seeding System**: Seed tasks from JSON for reproducible scenarios.
- 🧪 **Dry-run and Decoy Mode**: Outputs harmless mock results for demos.
- 🔧 **Configurable Ghost Profiles**: Define fake identity profiles with behavior triggers.
- 🧼 **Wipe & Vanish Simulation**: Task results can be set to auto-delete or simulate disappearance.

> This project intentionally leaves critical parts obfuscated or incomplete to prevent real-world abuse.

## 🧠 Conceptual Use Cases

- Stress test SOC/SIEM pipelines with simulated anomalies.
- Train detection systems with decoy noise and false indicators.
- Academic research into adversarial simulation and cyber deception.
- Honeypot system enhancement via simulated traffic.

> ⚠️ Real-world use may fall under cybersecurity regulation. Ensure you comply with local and international law.
